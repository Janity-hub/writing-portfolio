# The Cost of Becoming Expensive
People often say, “You’re good at everything,” as if being capable across multiple domains is a personal choice or a badge of honor.

It isn’t. Not for me.

I became competent across fields not because I was ambitious or gifted, but because I couldn’t rely on anyone.
I couldn’t delegate key responsibilities. I couldn’t count on stable support. When you grow up in chaos, you learn that the safest way forward is to build everything yourself.

That means learning the tools, expanding your thinking, anticipating failure, absorbing more, and asking less.

## The Hidden Cost of Self-Construction
What people see as “confidence” is often a survival structure built on three forms of cost:

- **Time cost:** Mastering tools, solving problems, reworking mistakes — often at the expense of rest, relationships, and spontaneity.

- **Emotional cost:** Carrying the weight of responsibility means living in a constant state of alertness, managing overload, suppressing vulnerability.

- **Cognitive cost:** You have to develop structural thinking, internal systems, and resilience under pressure just to keep functioning.

This doesn’t result in ease or satisfaction. It merely gives you a somewhat stable foothold in an unstable world.

## What It Means to Be “Expensive”
Over time, these costs consolidate into a system — and that system makes a person expensive.

Not in attitude. In resource density.

**When someone has spent years filling structural gaps with effort, their time, attention, judgment, and boundaries carry actual weight.**

They’re not difficult. They’re calibrated.

They don’t accept low standards because they’ve built high ones from scratch. They’re not dismissive — they’re protecting the compound investment it took to become functional.

## Why This Gets Misread
Their restraint is read as arrogance.

Their precision is seen as cold.

Their refusal to tolerate chaos is labeled “controlling” or “high maintenance.”

But they aren’t pushing others away — they’ve just spent too long carrying things alone to pretend it was easy.

## It’s Not About Status. It’s About Cost.
Some people have privilege handed to them. Others had to build theirs.
When you meet the second type, respect is not optional. It’s structural.

If someone built their clarity, stability, and discernment from the ground up, asking them to “lower their standards” isn’t humility — it’s erasure.

I never wanted to be exceptional. I just didn’t want to fall apart.

So I built a tower. It’s solid. It’s steady. And yes — it’s expensive.

Not because I think I’m rare.
But because it took everything I had to become unshakeable.
