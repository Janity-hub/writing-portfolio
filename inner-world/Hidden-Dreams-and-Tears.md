I'm Deeply Emotional — I Just Learned to Hide It Well
Subtitle: A confession from a romantic who learned to live inside a rational shell

When I realized that being emotional couldn’t protect me,
I dismantled myself and rebuilt my soul in a rational structure.
This piece is written for the version of me still hiding in that imaginary utopia.
And for anyone who seems calm in the crowd,
but is still burning on the inside.

I’m not really a rational realist.
In truth, I’m deeply emotional—wildly imaginative, and often lost in daydreams.

I’ve spent countless hours buried in music, anime, novels—
those quiet corners of the world where I built my own Peach Blossom Spring.
My emotions are intense, my sensitivity overwhelming.
I could spend an entire day listening to the same song,
spiraling into thoughts, tears silently falling.

But that couldn’t go on.

My detachment from reality led me into chaos,
and my emotional richness was dismissed as irrational, unreliable.

So I created the opposite of who I was.

I broke down my feelings with logic,
converted them into cold structures of reason.
I buried my fantasies, forced myself to face the real world.

Now I appear strong—ruthlessly rational,
almost void of emotion, wired with overactive analysis.
I can handle anything.
I shut down my emotions in a flash, clear out every thought,
and focus solely on solving the problem.

But underneath that lies a heavily suppressed softness—
a quiet, idealistic dreamer still alive and breathing.

Whenever I’m in a safe space,
I still slip back into my world of imagination as easily as ever.
None of it was ever truly lost.
It’s just waiting for the right moment to return.


我是感性的，但我伪装得很好
一个理性壳子里的理想主义者自述

当我意识到“感性不能保护我”，我就把自己拆开，装进了一个理性结构里。
这篇，是我写给那个仍然躲在桃花源深处的自己。
也写给每一个在人群中看起来很冷，但内心仍在燃烧的人。

我其实不是什么理性的现实主义者，实际上我极端感性和喜爱幻想。
​我花费大量时间沉浸在歌曲动漫小说里，在那里塑造了一个桃花源。
我的情绪浓烈，感受力强得几乎能把自己淹没。我可以听一首歌整整一天，胡思乱想、默默流泪。

​但是这样不行。
​我的缺乏实际让我落入糟糕的境地，我的情感丰富被当成不理性和不可靠。

​所以我塑造了一个反面。
​我用逻辑拆解了自己的情绪，把它们变成理性，我把自己的幻想藏起来让自己关注现实。
​我现在变得很强，极端的理性甚至缺乏情绪，过度强化的分析能力；；
它们能帮我应对任何情况，我会瞬间冷静下来，丢掉所有情绪和杂念只专注解决事情。

但是与之相对的，是被藏起来极度压抑的感性，和理想主义的想象；
​只要重新回到安静的环境，我同样随时能沉浸到幻想世界；
这些我从未丢失，只是需要安全的时候恢复。
